One instruction is enough: Codex turns a polished diagram generated with
GPT Image 2 into a PPTX; open it in PowerPoint and use **Ungroup** or
**Convert to Shape** to edit the reconstructed elements. Note: Editing 
lower-level elements may require **ungrouping** multiple times, as our 
reconstruction process uses a multi-level grouping hierarchy.

```text
Use $img2pptx to turn this image into an editable PPTX.
```

After reconstruction, if any part is unsatisfactory, simply describe the desired
change in the conversation and ask Codex to revise it. All vectorized elements
and their structure are preserved, so the relevant text, shapes, colors, layout,
or connections can be edited directly without regenerating the entire image.

## Example: research figure reconstruction

The source below is a method figure from
[Revisiting Uncertainty: On Evidential Learning for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.06083).
It was supplied as a PDF and reconstructed as an editable SVG.

```text
Use $img2pptx to reconstruct methodv3.pdf as a one-slide editable PPTX.
```

Click the reconstructed preview to open the full-resolution SVG. This example is
built from editable SVG text and vector primitives and contains no embedded
`<image>` elements. In a complete run, the SVG is embedded into `final.pptx`.

## Install

### Recommended: install from GitHub

In Codex, invoke `$skill-installer` and provide this repository path:

```text
$skill-installer Install this skill from:
https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/img2pptx/tree/main/skills/img2pptx
```

中文安装提示：

```text
$skill-installer 请从 GitHub 安装这个 skill：
https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/img2pptx/tree/main/skills/img2pptx
```

Codex detects newly installed skills automatically. If it does not appear,
restart Codex or start a new task.

### Manual installation

For a personal skill, copy `skills/img2pptx` to:

```text
~/.agents/skills/img2pptx
```

For a repository-scoped skill, copy it to:

```text
YOUR_REPOSITORY/.agents/skills/img2pptx
```

## Use in Google Antigravity

One command syncs the Skill (protocol) and the MCP server (deterministic tools):

```bash
pip install -r mcp/img2pptx_mcp/requirements.txt
python3 scripts/sync_antigravity.py            # workspace: .agent/skills/ + .agents/mcp_config.json
python3 scripts/sync_antigravity.py --global   # optional: ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/ + global MCP config
```

Reopen the workspace (or run `/mcp`) and the `img2pptx` server exposes tools
such as `render_svg`, `compare_images`, `embed_svg_pptx`, and `audit_pptx`.
See [docs/antigravity.md](docs/antigravity.md) (Chinese) for details.

## More usage examples

中文：

```text
使用 $img2pptx，把这张图片转为可编辑的 PPTX。
```

For more control:

```text
Use $img2pptx to reconstruct diagram.png as a one-slide editable PPTX.
Preserve the original aspect ratio, text, colors, arrows, and scientific symbols.
```

The skill may also trigger automatically when a request clearly asks to convert,
rebuild, trace, or vectorize a raster reference into an editable PowerPoint slide.

## What it produces

The main deliverable is `final.pptx`. A complete run also produces:

- `full.svg` — the full vector reconstruction embedded in the PPTX;
- `component_manifest.json` — semantic components, hierarchy, geometry, and constraints;
- `modules/*.svg` — independently reusable semantic modules;
- `qa/*` — layout, containment, border, semantic, visual, and PPTX embedding audits.

## Why not just put the image on a slide?

`img2pptx` treats the reference as a reconstruction task rather than a screenshot
placement task. It aims to preserve:

- editable SVG text and vector primitives;
- meaningful nested groups and reusable modules;
- arrows, containment, sequence, color semantics, and scientific notation;
- an auditable relationship between the source image, SVG, and PPTX.

Raster crops are used only when an element cannot be reproduced reliably as a
vector without losing its visual identity.

## Editability and PowerPoint compatibility

The PPTX contains the complete `full.svg`, not only a full-slide bitmap.
Recent PowerPoint versions can usually use **Convert to Shape** and **Ungroup**
on an SVG. Exact text conversion, nested group preservation, and appearance
depend on the PowerPoint version, operating system, fonts, and SVG importer.

The skill reports these separately:

1. whether the complete SVG is embedded;
2. whether the SVG is structurally ready for conversion;
3. whether an actual PowerPoint conversion was tested.

It does not claim perfect post-conversion fidelity unless that conversion was
actually performed and inspected.

## Supported references

Common inputs include:

- AI-generated diagrams and infographics;
- research-paper architecture figures;
- scientific workflows and symbolic diagrams;
- flowcharts, process diagrams, and system overviews;
- screenshots, PNG, JPG/JPEG, and WebP files.

Use only images you have permission to reproduce.

## Status

This is an early open-source release. More real-world examples and regression
tests will be added as the workflow is tested across additional diagram styles
and runtime environments.
